# Initial notes
The package did not seem to work with the newest version (1.11) of Julia because there were dependency issues. With Julia version 1.9 it can be installed and used.


# Examples
## Patterning

### Notes
| Difficulties | Tricks |
| :----------- | :----- |
| Defining complex functions and their many parameters can be daunting at first |  |

## ICM development

![ICM Development3](https://github.com/MarkoKorb/CellBasedModelsF1/blob/master/results/icm_development_statistics.png)

### Notes
| Difficulties | Tricks |
| :----------- | :----- |
| @step: Fitting the model - Upload experimental data the authors want to read a csv file with data but it is not provided to the reader as far as I can tell. I can't continue implementing the example |  |

## Particle aggregation

### Notes
| Difficulties | Tricks |
| :----------- | :----- |
| The second last code block leads to a “nested task error: BoundsError” |  |

## Bacterial colony growth
### Notes
| Difficulties | Tricks |
| :----------- | :----- |
| Can't initialize the community because there are errors with the (not) defined platform |  |

## Bacterial chemotaxis
